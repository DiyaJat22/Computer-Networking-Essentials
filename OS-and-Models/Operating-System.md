# 🖥️ Functions of Operating System

An **Operating System (OS)** is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware.

---

## 🔧 1. Process Management
- The OS handles the creation, scheduling, and termination of processes.
- It manages multitasking by allocating CPU time to each process.
- Ensures synchronization and communication between processes (Interprocess Communication).

---

## 💾 2. Memory Management
- Keeps track of each byte in a computer’s memory and manages allocation and deallocation.
- Ensures that processes do not interfere with each other’s memory.
- Uses techniques like paging, segmentation, and virtual memory.

---

## 📁 3. File System Management
- Manages data storage using a file system structure.
- Provides operations like creation, deletion, reading, writing, and access control.
- Organizes files into directories for easy access and storage.

---

## 🌐 4. Device Management
- Controls and coordinates the use of hardware devices through device drivers.
- Performs I/O operations and manages data flow to and from peripherals like keyboards, printers, etc.
- Uses buffering, spooling, and caching to optimize performance.

---

## 🧑‍💼 5. User Interface
- Provides a way for users to interact with the system (CLI or GUI).
- Manages user accounts, permissions, and sessions.

---

## 🔒 6. Security and Protection
