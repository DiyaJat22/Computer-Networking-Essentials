# üåê OSI Model vs TCP/IP Model ‚Äì Networking Fundamentals

The OSI and TCP/IP models are conceptual frameworks used to understand and implement computer networking protocols. They define how data is transmitted from one device to another through different layers.

## üì¶ OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)

The OSI model has **7 layers**, each with specific functions. It is a **theoretical model** used for understanding and designing a network system.

### üß± 7 Layers of OSI Model:

| Layer No. | Layer Name       | Description                                                                 |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 7         | Application       | End-user interface; supports applications like browsers, email clients     |
| 6         | Presentation      | Data translation, encryption, and compression                              |
| 5         | Session           | Manages sessions and controls dialogues between devices                    |
| 4         | Transport         | Provides reliable or unreliable delivery; uses TCP or UDP                  |
| 3         | Network           | Handles logical addressing and routing (IP)                                |
| 2         | Data Link         | MAC addresses, error detection, and flow control                           |
| 1         | Physical          | Transmission of raw bit stream over physical medium                        |

## üåê TCP/IP Model (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)

The TCP/IP model is a **practical model** used in real-world networking. It consists of **4 layers**, and it forms the basis of the modern internet.

### üîπ 4 Layers of TCP/IP Model:

| Layer No. | Layer Name       | Corresponding OSI Layers                     | Description                                       |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 4         | Application       | Application, Presentation, Session          | Provides network services to end-user applications|
| 3         | Transport         | Transport                                   | Ensures reliable data delivery (TCP/UDP)          |
| 2         | Internet          | Network                                     | Handles routing and addressing (IP)               |
| 1         | Network Access    | Data Link + Physical                        | Deals with physical transmission and MAC addressing|

## üéØ Key Differences

- **OSI** separates **Presentation** and **Session** layers, while **TCP/IP** merges them into the **Application Layer**.
- **TCP/IP** is protocol-specific, whereas **OSI** is protocol-independent.
- **TCP/IP** is used in real-time data transmission over the Internet; **OSI** is used for teaching and architecture modeling.
