# Network Topologies

Network topology refers to the arrangement of different elements (links, nodes, etc.) in a computer network. Below are the main types of network topologies:

## 1. Bus Topology
 - All devices share a single central cable (backbone).
 - Data travels in both directions but can collide.
 - Failure of the backbone affects the whole network.

 ### Advantages:
 - Easy to install.
 - Requires less cable.

 ### Disadvantages:
 - Difficult to troubleshoot.
 - Performance degrades with heavy traffic.

## 2. Star Topology
- All devices connect to a central hub or switch.
- The hub manages network communication.

### Advantages:
- Easy to install and manage.
- Failure of one device does not affect others.

### Disadvantages:
- Failure of the hub affects the whole network.
- Requires more cable than bus topology.

## 3. Ring Topology
- Devices are connected in a circular manner.
- Data travels in one direction (unidirectional) or both (bidirectional).

### Advantages:
- Reduces data collisions.
- Good for high-speed networks.

### Disadvantages:
- Failure of one node can break the network.
- Difficult to troubleshoot.

## 4. Mesh Topology
- Every device is connected to every other device.
- Provides multiple paths for data transmission.

### Advantages:
- High redundancy and reliability.
- Failure of one node does not affect the entire network.

### Disadvantages:
- Expensive due to a large number of connections.
- Complex to set up and maintain.

## 5. Tree Topology
- A combination of bus and star topologies.
- Devices are connected in a hierarchical manner.

### Advantages:
- Scalable and easy to expand.
- Fault isolation is easier.

### Disadvantages:
- Failure of the main backbone can affect the network.
- Requires more cable.

## 6. Hybrid Topology
- A combination of two or more different topologies.
- Used in large networks where different requirements exist.

### Advantages:
- Flexible and scalable.
- Efficient performance.

### Disadvantages:
- Complex design and high cost.
- Requires advanced network management.
