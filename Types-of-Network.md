# Types of Networks

## 1. Personal Area Network (PAN)
A PAN is the smallest network type, used for personal devices such as smartphones, tablets, and wearables. It typically covers a range of a few meters.

### Examples:
- Bluetooth connections
- Infrared connections
- Zigbee networks

## 2. Local Area Network (LAN)
A LAN connects devices within a limited area such as a home, office, or campus. It is commonly used for high-speed data sharing and communication.

### Examples:
- Ethernet networks
- Wi-Fi networks within a home or office

## 3. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
A MAN spans a city or a large campus, providing network connectivity to multiple LANs.

### Examples:
- City-wide Wi-Fi
- Cable TV networks

## 4. Wide Area Network (WAN)
A WAN covers large geographical areas, often connecting multiple LANs and MANs.

### Examples:
- The Internet
- Corporate networks spanning multiple locations

## 5. Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)
A WLAN is similar to a LAN but uses wireless communication instead of wired connections.

### Examples:
- Home Wi-Fi networks
- Public Wi-Fi hotspots

## 6. Storage Area Network (SAN)
A SAN is a high-speed network designed for data storage and retrieval, typically used in enterprise environments.

### Examples:
- Fibre Channel SAN
- iSCSI SAN

## 7. Virtual Private Network (VPN)
A VPN extends a private network across a public network, allowing secure data transmission.

### Examples:
- Secure remote access for employees
- Encrypted communication over the internet

## 8. Enterprise Private Network (EPN)
An EPN is a private network built by organizations to securely connect different branches and offices.

### Examples:
- Corporate intranet
- Secure connections between company locations

## 9. Campus Area Network (CAN)
A CAN is a network that connects multiple LANs within a specific campus or educational institution.

### Examples:
- University network infrastructure
- Industrial complex network

## 10. Home Area Network (HAN)
A HAN connects devices within a home environment, including smart home appliances.

### Examples:
- Smart home automation
- IoT-based home systems
